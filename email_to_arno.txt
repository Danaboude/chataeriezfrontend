Subject: Completion of Angular Chat App Demo - Technical Overview

Hi Arno,

I'm excited to share that I have finished the development of the Angular Chat Application. It is now fully functional and ready for you to test!

### 🌍 Live Demo
You can access the app here: https://chataeriezfrontend.vercel.app/

### 📋 How to Test
1. **Multi-Device Testing**: To see the real-time interaction, open the link on two different devices (e.g., your laptop and your phone) or use two different browsers/incognito tabs.
2. **User Selection**: Select a different user profile for each device (e.g., "Alice" on one and "Bob" on the other).
3. **Private Chat**: Click on the user's name in the sidebar to start a private conversation.

### 🚀 Technical Overview & Architecture
This project was built to demonstrate a scalable real-time messaging architecture.

**Frontend:** Angular (latest version)
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS, optimized for both desktop and mobile. I've implemented a WhatsApp-style floating chat bar for mobile.
- **State Management**: Uses RxJS for handling real-time data streams and Socket.IO for the connection bridge.
- **Local Storage**: For this demo, message history is stored locally in your browser's `localStorage`. In a production environment, we would integrate a persistent database (like MongoDB or PostgreSQL).

**Backend:** Node.js / Express
- **Messaging Protocol**: Uses MQTT (via RabbitMQ) for reliable and scalable message delivery. 
- **Broker**: I used **CloudAMQP** (RabbitMQ) as the managed messaging broker.
- **Bridge**: The backend acts as a bridge between Socket.IO (frontend) and MQTT (broker), ensuring low-latency communication.

**Notifications & Synchronization:**
- **Smart Notifications**: I've implemented a Service Worker to handle background notifications. You will receive notifications even if the app is closed or if you are chatting in a different room.
- **Unread Counters**: Real-time red badges appear in the sidebar to alert you of background messages.
- **Sync Logic**: The backend uses global broadcasting. This ensures that Alice receives Bob's private messages instantly, even if she is currently focused on the "General" group chat.

### 📂 Features
- **Real-time Text Messaging**: Instant delivery and local persistence.
- **Voice Messages**: Record and send high-quality audio clips.
- **File & Image Sharing**: Share images and files effortlessly.
- **Mobile Optimized**: Smooth, app-like experience on smartphones.

### ⚠️ Note on Hosting
I am using free tiers for deployment (Vercel for Frontend and Render.com for Backend).
- **Cold Start**: If the app hasn't been used for a while, the backend on Render might take 30-60 seconds to "wake up" the first time you send a message. Please be patient during the first connection!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss how we can expand this into a full-scale production system with server-side storage!
